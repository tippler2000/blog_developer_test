#Blog developer test

Welcome to the Homeflow developer test app, which is a simple blog application in Rails 4.

We would like you to extend this mini app and add the following:

-	**Post comments** Adding the ability for logged in users to comment on blog posts. These should be displayed on the post show page appropriately. If you want you can also require comments to be accepted by a moderator first before showing.
-	**User avatars** Add an avatar for a user. You can use any method/gem you like for this. Then render these with the appropriate comments on the post page.

You shouldn't normally spend more then 3 hours on this. You're most welcome to use any resource to work on this; we only ask that you don't use outside help or just copy someone's code. Basic test coverage is required, you can see the example post controller spec is already there.

A preferred way for us to see your work would be for you to:

-	Do a bare clone of the public repo.
-	Create a new private one.
-	Do a mirror push to the new private one.
-	This is documented on GitHub: duplicating-a-repository
